**World Happiness Index** is a comprehensive indicator that measures the level of perceived happiness in various countries. It was developed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a network for sustainable development solutions operating under the aegis of the United Nations (UN). The data for the index is derived from extensive surveys where respondents rate their lives on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating the worst possible quality of life and 10 the best.

The ranking is published annually, and the results are used not only to assess the progress of countries towards sustainable development goals but also serve as a tool for policymakers to develop and modify policies aimed at enhancing the overall level of happiness and quality of life.

This index serves as an important diagnostic tool that helps understand how different policies and socio-economic conditions affect the well-being of citizens, thereby contributing to promoting global initiatives aimed at building more harmonious and happier societies.
